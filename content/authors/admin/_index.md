I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at the University of Virginia. I work in the Collaborative Robotics Lab under the supervision of Prof. Tariq Iqbal. As a recipient of the National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT), I am also a member of the  University of Virginia’s Link Lab. Previously, I attended Brown University where I earned my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and played for the Varsity Brown Women’s Basketball Team.

My research focuses on Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), and I am particularly interested in observing real-time trust dynamics between human-robot teams.
